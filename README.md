At a minimum, it must:

- permit quick changes to one's works-in-progress, on the fly, using handheld devices
- integrate naturally with a revision management system, for preserving/accessing all of one's prior work
- swiftly synchronize its data across multiple devices, even after long stretches of offline use
- encourage the user along a steep learning curve, until he can grasp unintuitive concepts like HTML formatting & CSS styling
- instantaneously provide intuitive publication stylings for various basic uses
- do its job—freeing the user from technical distractions, to focus on greater composition, presentation & publication tasks

Does this text editor already exist? Packaged in a tight bundle? And deployed from an open source project?

Such is the intent with mulight™.
