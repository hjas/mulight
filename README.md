*Markup-lightweight / HTML text editor*

A productive text editor must:

- permit quick changes to works-in-progress, on the fly, using handheld devices
- integrate naturally with a revision management system, for preserving all of one's prior work
- keep data synchronized across multiple devices, even after being used offline for long stretches
- encourage the user along a steep learning curve until he can grasp unintuitive concepts like HTML formatting & CSS styling
- provide intuitive, instantaneous publication stylings for various basic uses
- do its job -- freeing the user from technical distractions, to focus on composition, styling & publication tasks

Does such a text editor exist? In a tight bundle? And as open source?

This is the intent of mulight.
