*Markup-lightweight / HTML text editor*

A productive text editor must:

- permit quick changes to one's works-in-progress, on the fly, using handheld devices
- integrate naturally with a revision management system, for preserving all of one's prior work
- keep its data synchronized across multiple devices, even after long stretches of offline use
- encourage the user along a steep learning curve, until he can grasp unintuitive concepts like HTML formatting & CSS styling
- provide instantaneous, intuitive publication stylings for various basic uses
- do its jobâ€”freeing the user from technical distractions, to focus on greater composition, presentation & publication tasks

Does this text editor already exist? Packaged in a tight bundle? And deployed from an open source project?

Such is the intent with mulight.
